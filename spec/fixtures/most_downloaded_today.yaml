    description: ! 'Diff::LCS is a port of Perl''s Algorithm::Diff that uses the McIlroy-Hunt

      longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compute intelligent differences

      between two sequenced enumerable containers. The implementation is based on

      Mario I. Wolczko''s {Smalltalk version 1.2}[ftp://st.cs.uiuc.edu/pub/Smalltalk/MANCHESTER/manchester/4.0/diff.st]

      (1993) and Ned Konz''s Perl version

      {Algorithm::Diff 1.15}[http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Algorithm-Diff-1.15/].


      This is release 1.1.3, fixing several small bugs found over the years. Version

      1.1.0 added new features, including the ability to #patch and #unpatch changes

      as well as a new contextual diff callback, Diff::LCS::ContextDiffCallbacks,

      that should improve the context sensitivity of patching.


      This library is called Diff::LCS because of an early version of Algorithm::Diff

      which was restrictively licensed. This version has seen a minor license change:

      instead of being under Ruby''s license as an option, the third optional license

      is the MIT license.'
